I really like the Otis-Forest theme [https://www.xfce-look.org/p/1619506] but I found the title bar too chunky, so I slimmed it down to make the title bar more slim and compact.

I only slimmed down the title bar, the minimise, hide and maximise buttons. No other buttons were modified.

Download the compressed theme, extract and put the theme folder in ~/.themes to have the XFCE window manager recognise the theme style.
